title: Determine an AWS Account's organizational
description: With access to the Cost Explorer Service, you can determine the name assigned to an account within an organization

Access to the Organiations service is very restricted when accessed from within a memeber account within an organization. Typically, you need access to the management account, or the member account you are in needs delegated administrative permissions to perform the `list-accounts` action.

There is a way to get around this using the Cost Explorer service. The following command will return the account's friendly name (provided that you have permissions to perform the action):
```
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=2023-06-28,End=2023-06-29 --granularity DAILY --metrics UsageQuantity --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=LINKED_ACCOUNT | jq '.DimensionValueAttributes[0].Attributes.description'
```

This could provide useful information as to what environment you are in (QA, Staging, Prod) and what workload is running within the account
