title: Abusing Misconfigured ECR Resource Policies
description: Common misconfigurations of resource-based policies and how they can be abused.
---

AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) [private registries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html) use resource-based policies to delineate which entities are permitted to push and pull containers. As a result, it is possible for these policies to be [misconfigured](/aws/exploitation/Misconfigured_Resource-Based_Policies/) and potentially abused. The following is an explanation of how these policies can be misconfigured as well as how you can take advantage of them.

!!! Note
    Aside from misconfigurations due to overbroad policies, you may find yourself in a position to abuse an ECR if you compromise a user or role which is designated in the resource-based policy.
